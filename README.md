# Retrospective and Prospective Power Analyses for Environmental Economics

This tutorial focuses on a **very** important threat for empirical research: the dangers of working with studies that have a low statistical power in the null hypothesis significance testing framework (NHST). Using a toy example, we first explain why statistically significant estimates exaggerate the true effect sizes of the causal estimands of interest when data are noisy. We then show how prospective and retrospective statistical power calculations can help improve the design of our studies. Changes in attitudes towards "statistical significance" are briefly discussed at the end and further readings are provided.

**The repository is organised as follows:**

* `tutorial_power.html` is a self-contained document with annotated R codes for the workshop.
* `slides_power.html` are the slides used in the workshop.
* The folder `scripts_tutorial` contains all the R scripts to be run during the workshop.
* The folder `data` contains the results of Monte-Carlo simulations.

This workshop heavily relies on the cited studies and works I have carried out with my fantastic co-author [Vincent Bagilet](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/causal_inflation/). Should you have any questions or find errors, do not hesitate to reach me.
